# Public Access Deployment Options

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Fastest)
Click the "Deploy" button in Replit to get instant public access with a `.replit.app` domain.

## Option 2: AWS EKS (Production)
Complete Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling and load balancing.

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with EKS cluster
- Domain name for SSL certificate
- AWS Load Balancer Controller installed

### Quick Deploy Steps
1. **Update Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Edit k8s/secret.yaml with your database URL
   # Edit k8s/ingress.yaml with your domain
   # Edit k8s/deploy.sh with your AWS account details
   ```

2. **Deploy to EKS**
   ```bash
   ./k8s/deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Access Application**
   Your app will be available at: `https://your-domain.com`

## Option 3: AWS App Runner (Simplified)
For easier AWS deployment without Kubernetes complexity:

1. **Create apprunner.yaml** (already included)
2. **Deploy via AWS Console**
   - Go to AWS App Runner
   - Create service from source code
   - Connect your repository
   - Use the included `apprunner.yaml` configuration

## Option 4: Direct Port Forwarding (Development)
For immediate testing:
```bash
# Make current server accessible (temporary)
# Note: Only use for testing, not production
ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 serveo.net
```

## Recommended Approach
- **Development/Testing**: Use Replit deployment
- **Production**: Use AWS EKS with your domain
- **Prototype Demo**: Use App Runner for quick AWS deployment

All deployment configurations are ready in your project.
