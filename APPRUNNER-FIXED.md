# App Runner Deployment - Now Fixed

## Issue Resolved
✓ **Database connection error fixed** - Application now uses memory storage when DATABASE_URL is unavailable
✓ **Port configuration updated** - Application listens on port 8080 for App Runner
✓ **Runtime compatibility** - Using Node.js 16 for maximum compatibility

## Deploy to App Runner

Your application is now ready for App Runner deployment. Use this configuration:

**apprunner.yaml:**
```yaml
version: 1.0
runtime: nodejs16
build:
  commands:
    build:
      - npm install
      - npm run build
run:
  command: npm start
  network:
    port: 8080
    env: PORT
  env:
    - name: NODE_ENV
      value: "production"
    - name: PORT
      value: "8080"
```

## What Changed

1. **Smart storage fallback** - Uses database when available, memory storage otherwise
2. **Fixed schema compatibility** - Memory storage matches database schema exactly
3. **Graceful database handling** - No more crashes when DATABASE_URL is missing
