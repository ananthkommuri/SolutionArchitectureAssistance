# AWS Deployment Options Summary

## App Runner Issues
- Runtime version compatibility problems in your region
- Build process failures with complex TypeScript/Vite setup
- Limited debugging capabilities

## Recommended Solution: ECS with EC2

### Why ECS with EC2 is Best:
1. **Full compatibility** - Works in all AWS regions
2. **Direct access** - SSH into instances for debugging
3. **Predictable costs** - Fixed monthly pricing (~$25-45/month)
4. **Complete control** - Custom configurations and scaling
5. **Production ready** - Auto-scaling and load balancing

### Deploy Now:
```bash
# From your local machine with AWS CLI configured
./k8s/ecs-ec2-deployment.sh
```

### What You Get:
- Public IP address with immediate access
- Container orchestration with ECS
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- Security groups configured for HTTP and SSH
- Ready for production traffic

### Alternative Options:
1. **ECS Fargate** - `./k8s/ecs-fargate-deployment.sh` (serverless containers)
2. **Elastic Beanstalk** - `./k8s/beanstalk-deployment.sh` (platform-as-a-service)

### Cost Comparison:
- ECS with EC2: $25-45/month (predictable)
- ECS Fargate: $20-40/month (pay-per-use)
- Elastic Beanstalk: $15-30/month (managed platform)

### Next Steps:
1. Download project to your local machine
2. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials
3. Run the ECS deployment script
4. Access your application at the provided public IP

Your AWS Solutions Architect application will be live and accessible within 10-15 minutes.
